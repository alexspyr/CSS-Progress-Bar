## Synopsis

This is a very basic use of CSS progress bard. You can customize everything.

## Code Example

	<h3>HTML</h3>
	<div class="progress">
		<div class="progress-bar" style="width: 90%;"></div>  //The width determines the progress in the progress bar.
	</div>

## Motivation

The progress bar is a very visual way to express usually hoow much you know something or how much something is completed. 
I usually use the progress bar when I am developing portofolio sites and I want a visual way to express how much someone knows 
something. 

## Installation

Just clone or download the 2 files and put them in the same folder.

## Contributors

I am planning on adding some nicer design on the future. If you want to help me maybe make it more material-like, fork the project
and then make a pull request. For any problems send me a message.
